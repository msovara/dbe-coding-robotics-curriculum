## Questions to Anticipate

### Potential Questions and Answers

**Q: How does this differ from CHPC's curriculum?**
A: "This curriculum is specifically designed for DBE teacher training with a focus on classroom application. It uses CHPC materials as technical reference while providing teacher-friendly structure, assessment tools, and curriculum integration guidance that CHPC's curriculum doesn't include."

**Q: What's the cost?**
A: "The curriculum itself is free and open-source. Hardware costs are approximately R3,000-5,000 for a basic setup serving 10-15 teachers. All software is free. The main costs are hardware procurement and facilitator time."

**Q: How long to implement?**
A: "The workshop is designed as a 5-day program. Preparation time depends on resource procurement, but the curriculum is ready to use immediately. We recommend a pilot with a small group first."

**Q: What if teachers have no experience?**
A: "The curriculum is designed for mixed experience levels. It includes differentiation strategies, step-by-step guides, and support for complete beginners. Teachers learn alongside their students."

**Q: How does this align with DBE curriculum?**
A: "The curriculum includes specific integration planning templates that map coding/robotics to DBE subjects (Math, Science, Technology, Languages). Each day includes curriculum alignment activities."

**Q: What about ongoing support?**
A: "The curriculum includes resource sharing structures, teacher network building, and action planning. It's designed to create sustainable communities of practice."
