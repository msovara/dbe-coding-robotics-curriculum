## Afternoon Session (3-4 hours)

### Session 3: Advanced Scratch Concepts (2 hours)
**Time:** 13:00 - 15:00

#### Learning Objectives
- Use variables to store information
- Work with lists for multiple data items
- Apply operators and conditions
- Create custom blocks (functions)

#### Activities

**Variables (30 minutes)**
- **Concept:** Variables store information that can change
- **Activity:** "Score Keeper"
  - Create a variable for score
  - Increase score when sprite is clicked
  - Display score on stage
- **Real-world connection:** Like a calculator's memory

**Lists (30 minutes)**
- **Concept:** Lists store multiple pieces of information
- **Activity:** "Shopping List"
  - Create a list
  - Add items to list
  - Display list on stage
- **Application:** Managing multiple students' names, scores, etc.

**Operators and Conditions (30 minutes)**
- **Operators:** Math operations (+, -, *, /)
- **Conditions:** If-then, if-then-else blocks
- **Activity:** "Number Guessing Game"
  - Use operators to calculate
  - Use conditions to check guesses
  - Provide feedback based on conditions

**Custom Blocks (30 minutes)**
- **Concept:** Create reusable code blocks
- **Activity:** "Draw Shapes Function"
  - Create custom block "draw square"
  - Create custom block "draw triangle"
  - Use custom blocks to create patterns
- **Pedagogical value:** Teaches functions and code reuse

**Break (15 minutes)**
