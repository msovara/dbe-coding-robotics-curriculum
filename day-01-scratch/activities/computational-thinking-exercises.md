# Computational Thinking Exercises
## Day 1 Activities

## Exercise 1: Algorithm Writing - "How to Make a Sandwich"

### Objective
Understand that algorithms are precise, step-by-step instructions.

### Instructions
1. Write step-by-step instructions for making a sandwich
2. Exchange instructions with a partner
3. Follow your partner's instructions exactly as written
4. Discuss: What worked? What was missing?

### Discussion Questions
- What made some instructions better than others?
- Why is precision important in algorithms?
- How does this relate to computer programming?

### Extension
- Write algorithm for "How to Brush Your Teeth"
- Identify patterns (repetitive steps)
- Create abstraction (generalize the process)

## Exercise 2: Pattern Recognition - "Find the Pattern"

### Objective
Recognize patterns in sequences and data.

### Activity
**Pattern Sequences:**
1. 2, 4, 6, 8, ? (What comes next?)
2. Red, Blue, Red, Blue, ? (What comes next?)
3. Circle, Square, Circle, Square, ? (What comes next?)

**Real-World Patterns:**
- Daily routines (wake up, breakfast, school, etc.)
- Seasons (summer, autumn, winter, spring)
- Math patterns (multiplication tables)

### Discussion
- How do patterns help us solve problems?
- Where do we see patterns in our daily lives?
- How can recognizing patterns help in coding?

## Exercise 3: Decomposition - "Plan a School Event"

### Objective
Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

### Activity
**Task:** Plan a school science fair

**Steps:**
1. List all the things needed for a science fair
2. Group related items together
3. Break each group into smaller tasks
4. Create a timeline

**Example Decomposition:**
- **Venue:** Book hall, set up tables, arrange seating
- **Participants:** Invite students, register projects, assign spaces
- **Judging:** Recruit judges, create criteria, schedule judging
- **Publicity:** Create posters, send invitations, announce winners

### Discussion
- Why is it easier to solve small problems than one big problem?
- How does this relate to writing computer programs?
- What happens if we skip steps in decomposition?

## Exercise 4: Abstraction - "Describe a Car"

### Objective
Focus on important details while ignoring irrelevant ones.

### Activity
**Task:** Describe a car to someone who has never seen one

**Levels of Abstraction:**
1. **Very Detailed:** "A red 2020 Toyota Corolla with 4 doors, 5 seats, engine in front, wheels made of rubber..."
2. **Moderate:** "A vehicle with 4 wheels, engine, seats, used for transportation"
3. **Abstract:** "A machine that moves people from one place to another"

### Discussion
- Which description is most useful? Why?
- When do we need detail? When can we use abstraction?
- How does abstraction help in programming?
- Example: In Scratch, we use "move 10 steps" without needing to know how the computer calculates pixels

## Exercise 5: Algorithm Debugging - "Fix the Instructions"

### Objective
Understand that algorithms must be correct and complete.

### Activity
**Broken Algorithm:** "How to Make Tea"
1. Put water in kettle
2. Add tea bag
3. Pour hot water
4. Drink tea

**Problems:**
- Missing: Turn on kettle, wait for water to boil, remove tea bag, add sugar/milk
- Wrong order: Tea bag added before water is hot

**Task:** Fix the algorithm

### Discussion
- What happens when algorithms have errors?
- How do we find and fix errors? (Debugging)
- Why is testing important?

---

## Exercise 6: Computational Thinking in Daily Life

### Objective
Recognize computational thinking in everyday activities.

### Activity
**Choose a daily activity and identify:**
- **Decomposition:** What are the steps?
- **Pattern Recognition:** What patterns exist?
- **Abstraction:** What are the key details?
- **Algorithm:** What is the sequence?

**Examples:**
- Getting ready for school
- Cooking a meal
- Doing homework
- Playing a game

### Reflection
- How do you already use computational thinking?
- How can you teach this to students?
- What activities in your subject use computational thinking?
